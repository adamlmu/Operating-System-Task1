# Operating-System-Task1
This task is an assignment for an Operating Systems course that involves working with the xv6 operating system, a simple Unix-like teaching operating system. The assignment consists of several tasks that aim to familiarize students with various aspects of operating system development, including system calls, scheduling policies, and process management.
The tasks are as follows:

Hello World: Writing a simple user-space program that prints "Hello World xv6" to the screen.
Kernel Space and System Calls: Implementing a new system call memsize() that returns the size of the running process's memory in bytes, and a user-space program to test it.
Goodbye World: Adding an "exit message" to the exit() system call, modifying the wait() system call to retrieve the exit message, and modifying the shell to print the exit message when a child process terminates.
Understand the existing scheduling policy: Understanding the current scheduling policy in xv6.
Priority Scheduling: Implementing a priority-based scheduling policy.
Completely Fair Scheduler with Priority Decay: Implementing a simplified version of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) algorithm with priority decay.
Dynamically changing scheduling policies: Implementing a system call to change the scheduling policy at runtime.

The assignment covers various aspects of operating system development, including system calls, process management, scheduling algorithms, and user-space programming. It provides hands-on experience with modifying the xv6 kernel and writing user-space programs to test the implemented features.
